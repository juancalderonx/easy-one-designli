Â¡Hi! I'm Juan, and welcome to the **_Backend Developer with NodeJS_** test repository. Here, you'll find the solution for the "easy-one" test. If you are looking for the "the-real-challenge" test, you can find it in [this repository](https://github.com/juancalderonx/skill-tests-designli).

## Easy-one Project

### Overview

This project is the solution to the "easy-one" test provided by Designli. It involves creating a NEST.js project, converting a JSON structure into a TypeScript class, implementing a controller with an endpoint to transform input JSON into another structure, and documenting the API using Swagger.

### Development Steps
